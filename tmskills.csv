# Weapon Proficiencies #
########################
Short Weapons,1,-,"You are trained in the use of short weapons. A ""short weapon"" is classified as being a hand-held melee weapon that is no more than roughly 20 inches long, from the end of the pommel to the tip of the blade."
One-handed Weapons,2,"Short Weapons","You are trained in the use of one-handed weapons. A “one-handed weapon” is classified as being a hand-held melee weapon that is no more than roughly 48 inches long, from the end of the pommel to the tip of the blade."
Two-handed Weapons,3,"One-handed Weapons","You are trained in the use of two-handed weapons. A “two-handed weapon” is classified as being a hand-held melee weapon that is more than roughly 48 inches long, from the end of the pommel to the tip of the blade."
Oversized Weapon Use,2,"Two-handed Weapons","You have built up enough strength and training to be able to use two-handed weapons in one hand. “Two-handed weapons” are classified as being longer than roughly 48 inches; without this skill, characters cannot wield such weapons in one hand, no matter how light they are. It is important to note, though, that weapons of this length will still qualify as “two-handed weapons” for all game-rule purposes, even if you are wielding them in one hand. For instance, the DISARM and FEINT skills can only be used when one is wielding a “one-handed weapon”—for this purpose, actual weapon length is more important than how many hands one happens to be using."
Thrown Weapons,2,-,"You have practiced the art of using weapons that are intended to be thrown (such as throwing daggers, chakram, and stones). Thrown weapons may be of any size, as long as they have been cleared for safety ahead of time by Twin Mask staff."
Bow and Arrow,3,-,"You have trained as an archer, such that you can use a bow effectively in combat. In Twin Mask, acceptable bows have a maximum draw strength of 30 pounds, archers may not fire at targets closer than 10 feet, all arrows must have a padded arrow tip larger than an average eye socket, and all arrows must be “pennied” (which means that a penny has been used to cover the end of the arrow shaft, inside the padding, so that the shaft cannot pierce the padding). Additionally, for safety reasons, no crossbows are allowed in Twin Mask."
Two-weapon Fighting: Apprentice,3,-,"You have practiced fighting with two weapons at once, to the point that you can wield “short weapons” (no more than 20 inches long) in both hands at the same time. Without this skill, characters cannot equip weapons in both hands."
Two-weapon Fighting: Journeyman,3,"Two-weapon Fighting: Apprentice","You have practiced fighting with two weapons at once, to the point that you can wield a “short weapon” (no more than 20 inches long) in one hand while you wield a “one-handed weapon” (between 20 and 48 inches long) in the other hand."
Two-weapon Fighting: Master,3,"Two-weapon Fighting: Journeyman","You have practiced fighting with two weapons at once, to the point that you can wield any two weapons, of any length, at the same time."

# Armor Proficiencies #
#######################
Armored Training: Light,2,-,"You have trained in the art of wearing light armors in combat, giving you effective mobility while still benefiting from added defense. Light armor is generally constructed of padding, soft leather, or studded leather."
Armored Training: Medium,2,"Armored Training: Light","You have trained in the art of wearing medium-weight armors in combat, giving you effective mobility while still benefiting from added defense. Medium-weight armor is generally constructed of hardened leather or chain."
Armored Training: Heavy,2,"Armored Training: Medium","You have trained in the art of wearing heavy armors in combat, giving you effective mobility while still benefiting from added defense. Heavy armor is generally constructed of metal plate."
Small Shield,3,-,"You have practiced using a small shield in combat, allowing you to move and block blows while maintaining your footing in the fight. You may equip a small shield—which is defined as “no longer in any one dimension than its wielder’s torso” if you dedicate an arm to using it.  Alternatively, though, you have the option of using a buckler-sized shield—defined as “no longer in any one dimension than its wielder’s forearm”—by strapping it to your forearm and leaving your hand free. If you choose to use a buckler in this way, you may use that hand for any martial purposes, including wielding a two-handed weapon or using TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING.  You may only ever equip 1 shield at a time."
Medium Shield,3,"Small Shield","You have practiced using a medium-sized shield in combat, allowing you to move and block blows while maintaining your footing in the fight. You may equip a medium shield—which is defined as “no longer in any one dimension than the distance from its wielder’s waist to the ground” if you dedicate an arm to using it. You may only ever equip 1 shield at a time."
Helmet Mastery,2,-,"You have had the opportunity to practice combat while wearing a helmet, such that your fighting style is not thrown off by a helmet’s restrictions on hearing or vision. Wearing a helmet in this way makes you immune to stun effects that are delivered by physical attacks (usually through the STUN skill)—when such an attack strikes you, you may call “no effect.” Stun effects delivered through other means (such as by gesture or by spell packet) cannot be blocked by a helmet in this way."
Visor Mastery,2,"Helmet Mastery","You have had the opportunity to practice combat while wearing a closed-faced helmet, such that your fighting style is not thrown off by a visor’s severe restriction of your visual field. Wearing a closed-faced helmet in this way makes you immune to any effects that are delivered by gaze— when an enemy calls a “by my gaze” effect, you may call “no effect.”"

# General Combat Skills #
#########################
Toughness,3*,-,"Through intense physical training, your body has become more resilient to damage. All player characters (and the vast majority of people in the world of Adelrune) default to a maximum Health Point total of 5—but, each time you take this skill, your character’s maximum Health Point total permanently increases by 1. It is important to note, though, that a character cannot take this skill more than 5 times. (Therefore, Twin Mask characters have an effective “natural” Health Point maximum cap of 10 HP.)"
Dodge,6*,-,"You have developed your agility to the point that, once in a while, you can suddenly evade almost any direct attack. Immediately after you are hit with any attack that could have been physically avoided (such as any weapon attack or a spell packet), you may call “dodge” to avoid suffering any effects from that attack. You do not need to physically leap aside, although some role-playing (of, perhaps, a quick twist of your torso) is encouraged. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of DODGE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Willpower,6*,-,"You have developed your mental resilience to the point that, once in a while, you can simply refuse to accept almost any single mind-based or indirect attack. When you would be affected by any attack that cannot be physically dodged—such as effects delivered by voice, gaze, potion, gesture, or ward—you may instead call “willpower” to avoid suffering any effects from that attack. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of WILLPOWER you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Parry,4*,-,"You have developed your combat skills to the point that, once in a while, you can use your weapon to block even the quickest or deadliest blows. As long as you are wielding a weapon, immediately after you are hit with a melee attack (or any effect that is delivered by melee attack) by an opponent, you may call “parry” to avoid suffering any effects from that attack. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of PARRY you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Guardian,4,"Parry","You are not just good at protecting yourself in combat—you have practiced fighting in tandem with allies, so you can also protect them from attacks while you are within arm’s reach. As long as you are wielding a weapon, whenever an ally is hit with a melee attack, you may immediately touch that ally and call “guard parry” to prevent them from suffering any effects from the attack.  This counts as expending 1 use of the PARRY skill, and you cannot use the GUARDIAN skill if you do not have extra uses of PARRY to spend."
Stamina Training,2,-,"You have physically conditioned yourself to the point that you can recover more quickly when you are exhausted or shaking off the effects of being gravely injured. Normally, a state of weakness lasts for 3 minutes; by taking this skill, however, you reduce the amount of time your character suffers weakness effects to only 2 minutes."
Great Stamina,4,"Stamina Training","You have physically conditioned yourself until you approach the pinnacle of fitness, so you can recover extremely quickly when you are exhausted or shaking off the effects of being gravely injured. Normally, a state of weakness lasts for 3 minutes; by taking this skill, however, you reduce the amount of time your character suffers weakness effects to only 1 minute."
3-Damage Strike,3*,-,"You really know how to put your full effort into a single blow. As you make a physical ranged or melee attack, you may choose to have that attack deal a base amount of 3 damage (and therefore call “3”). If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of 3-DAMAGE STRIKE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
5-Damage Strike,6*,-,"You know how to strike with both precision and force, dealing a devastating amount of damage with a single blow. As you make a physical ranged or melee attack, you may choose to have that attack deal a base amount of 5 damage (and therefore call “5”). If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of 5-DAMAGE STRIKE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Stun,3*,-,"You have learned how to occasionally strike your foes much harder than they expect, knocking them off balance and giving you (and your allies) an opportunity to press the advantage. As you make a physical ranged or melee attack, you may call “stun” once. This produces a stun effect, replacing the damage that your attack would normally deal. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of STUN you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."

# Archery and Woodcraft #
#########################
Precision,7,"Bow and Arrow, 3-Damage Strike ×2","Through extensive practice with the bow, you have gained the ability to focus your attacks on the weak parts of enemies’ defenses, constantly dealing more damage through accuracy rather than raw force. Whenever you attack with a bow, you deal a base amount of 2 damage (and therefore may call “2”)."
Master Precision,7,"Precision, 5-Damage Strike ×2","Through constant practice with the bow, you have become a master archer, with the ability to pierce an enemy’s defenses and strike for significant amounts of damage with every arrow.  Whenever you attack with a bow, you deal a base amount of 3 damage (and therefore may call “3”)."
Ranged Disarm,*6,"Precision","With a steady hand and a quick eye, you can knock an enemy’s weapon out of their hands. As you make an attack with a bow, you may call “disarm” once. This produces a disarm effect, replacing the damage that your attack would normally deal. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of RANGED DISARM you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Volley Master,10,"Master Precision","You have learned to not only use a bow masterfully but also organize other archers to stand together and strike at the perfect time. If you are part of a group of at least 3 archers, each of whom is standing within arm’s reach of another member of the group, you can order all of them to launch arrows at the same time by calling “Loose!” (or perhaps “Volley!” or “Fire!”). If you do, and if at least 3 arrows are simultaneously fired immediately afterward, each of those arrows will deal a base amount of 5 damage (and each archer may therefore call “5”). This process can be repeated as often as all the archers in the VOLLEY can ready another arrow (as long as you call, each time, for a unified strike). To qualify as an “archer” for the purposes of this skill, a character must have the BOW AND ARROW skill, and they must actually have arrows to fire. They do not need to have either PRECISION or MASTER PRECISION."
Tracking,3,-,"You have spent the time needed to practice the art of following tracks—whether they were left by animals or people—in a variety of surroundings. To use this skill, you must call “bid – tracking” and explain your intentions to a Twin Mask staff member, who will then lead you in the direction that the tracks lead. This skill will almost always be used when you are on a “mod” away from the main space of the Twin Mask game, or perhaps on your way to such a mod, if you are following someone who has left the main game space. (If you are following a fleeing person or animal in this way, you must begin tracking them within 30 minutes of their leaving in order to have any chance of catching up.) TRACKING can generally not be used within the main game space: if the person or animal you intend to track is still “in play,” you must actually search for them, with no active help from Twin Mask staff."
Mask Tracks,6,"Tracking","Your time carefully looking for others’ tracks has given you insight into what a tracker would look for, so you know how to keep others from finding you. If you have this skill, others cannot use the TRACKING skill to follow your trail."
Mask Tracks: Group,4,"Mask Tracks","Your mastery of “leaving no trace” has been honed to the point that, if you put in the effort, you can keep anyone from being able to follow you, even if you are with a group of people. When you use this skill, you must continually role-play the process of sweeping the area behind your group of traces of your passage. If you do, then you can protect a group of up to 6 additional people and yourself from being followed with the TRACKING skill."
False Tracks,6,"Mask Tracks","In addition to sweeping away any traces of your passage, you have practiced the ability to leave misleading tracks in their place. When you use this skill, you must role-play the process of rearranging your tracks and fabricating new ones. If you do, then you can produce tracks that represent a different number of people, a different destination, or a different kind of person (or animal) than your normal tracks would indicate."
False Tracks: Group,6,"False Tracks","You have practiced the art of leaving misleading traces of your passage so much that you can replace the tracks of an entire group with completely different ones. When you use this skill, you must role-play the process of rearranging your party’s tracks and fabricating new ones. If you do, then you can produce tracks that represent a different number of people, a different destination, or a different kind of person (or animal) than your group’s normal tracks would indicate. This skill can affect the tracks of a group of 6 people in addition to yourself"
Scouting,2,"Tracking","You are stealthy enough to investigate outlying areas on your own, staying safe and not alerting enemies to your presence, so that you can report any likely incursions to your allies ahead of time. To use this skill, you must spend 30 minutes role-playing the process of scouting and patrolling the perimeter of the main Twin Mask game space. After you have done so, you may approach the “logistics” section of Twin Mask’s staff area and ask staff members 3 yes-or-no questions about what kinds of attacks or other incursions are likely to trouble the main game space within the next 3 hours. Staff members will answer your questions as well as they can, although you should keep in mind that the ever-changing nature of Twin Mask can eventually make those answers less than 100% accurate. The SCOUTING skill can only be used once per game."

# Officer Training #
####################
Sudden Motivation,1*,-,"You are practiced in the art of persuading an ally to push through temporary weakness—and sometimes a swift slap to the face is the greatest motivator. By role-playing 3 seconds of physical contact with an ally (such as by pretending to slap, shake, or kick them) and saying something motivational (such as “I KNOW this isn’t enough to take you down!”), you gain the ability to use a single, touch-based Remove Weakness effect on that ally. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of SUDDEN MOTIVATION you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Inspirational Speech,2*,-,"You are practiced in the art of motivation—whether you are inspiring people just by shouting your enthusiasm or by weaving a complex web of words, you know how to give a speech that will people back up on their feet and pushing forward. To use this skill, you must give a 30- second motivational speech to the people around you. If you do, you gain the ability to produce a single, voice-delivered Remove Weakness effect on everyone within earshot. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Defensive Instruction,4*,"Parry","You have mastered the art of melee combat, to the point that you can effectively teach others how to block all kinds of blows. After spending 30 seconds role-playing the process of giving an ally focused instruction on how to fight defensively with melee weapons, you gain the ability to use a single, touch-based “bestow parry” effect on that ally. This means that, for the next 30 minutes, that ally may use the PARRY ability 1 additional time, as though they had taken the related skill themselves. At the end of this 30-minute period, the bestowed use of PARRY goes away, whether the ally used it or not. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of DEFENSIVE INSTRUCTION you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Evasive Instruction,6*,"Dodge","You have mastered the art of avoiding harm, to the point that you can effectively teach others how to duck out of the way of all kinds of attacks. After spending 30 seconds role-playing the process of giving an ally focused instruction on how to watch for danger and get out of the way, you gain the ability to use a single, touch-based “bestow dodge” effect on that ally. This means that, for the next 30 minutes, that ally may use the DODGE ability 1 additional time, as though they had taken the related skill themselves. At the end of this 30-minute period, the bestowed use of DODGE goes away, whether the ally used it or not. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of EVASIVE INSTRUCTION you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Offensive Instruction,6*,"5-Damage Strike","You have mastered the art of striking with brutal efficiency, to the point that you can effectively teach others how to make a single attack that will devastate their foes. After spending 30 seconds role-playing the process of giving an ally focused instruction on how to hit others where it hurts the most, you gain the ability to use a single, touch-based “bestow 5-damage strike” effect on that ally. This means that, for the next 30 minutes, that ally may use the 5-DAMAGE STRIKE ability 1 additional time, as though they had taken the related skill themselves. At the end of this 30-minute period, the bestowed use of 5-DAMAGE STRIKE goes away, whether the ally used it or not. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of OFFENSIVE INSTRUCTION you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Military Drill,10,"Defensive Instruction OR Evasive Instruction OR Offensive Instruction","You have spent so much time teaching others how to handle themselves in a fight that you can produce some amazing, lasting results when you can get people to actually focus on even a fairly brief drill of combat skills. Once per game, you can spend 30 minutes role-playing through a “combat class” with as many people as are interested in participating, thereby bestowing on them valuable abilities that will last for days. The 30-minute MILITARY DRILL itself can focus on a mixture of any on-theme martial activities, including sparring, defense, offense, tactics, or even just marching. (Part of the drill should involve giving a brief, out-of-character explanation of the benefits that participating characters will receive from the class: this constitutes the “special” call listed above.) At the end of the MILITARY DRILL, you can bestow long-lasting abilities that resemble the effects that you could normally bestow with the DEFENSIVE INSTRUCTION, EVASIVE INSTRUCTION, and OFFENSIVE INSTRUCTION skills. The abilities you can bestow are based on which of those three skills you have: if you have all three, then you can bestow special versions of PARRY, DODGE, and 5-DAMAGE STRIKE on all participants—but if you only have 1 or 2 of those skills, your MILITARY DRILL will be more limited. The abilities bestowed by MILITARY DRILL are “special” because they last for 3 full days, with the added bonus that they gain the “Returns With: Rest” property. This means that, for most intents and purposes, participants can act as though their characters had actually gained the related skills for the entire duration of the game session. Of course, in order to gain these benefits, participants must be directly involved with the full 30 minutes of the drill—although it is worth noting that, if a MILITARY DRILL is interrupted by unplanned combat (such as, for instance, a sudden attack by bandits), the drill can simply resume after the interruption. As long as participants begin drilling again with a gap of less than 3 minutes between real combat and practice, the drill can continue exactly where it left off rather than having to start over."
Self-Observation,4,"Defensive Instruction OR Evasive Instruction OR Offensive Instruction","They say that the best way to learn something is to teach it—and, as an advanced instructor and drillmaster in the arts of combat, you have the opportunity to constantly remind yourself of basic, effective combat techniques. Whenever you use the DEFENSIVE INSTRUCTION, EVASIVE INSTRUCTION, OFFENSIVE INSTRUCTION, or MILITARY DRILL skills, you gain the same benefit(s) that your students do."

# The Art of Dueling #
######################
Disarm,4*,-,"As a duelist, you have learned how to strike at your foes’ weapons in a way that can knock those weapons to the ground, giving you a huge advantage until your enemies can pick them up again.  You may only use this skill if you are wielding a “short” or “one-handed” weapon (that is, a melee weapon that is 48 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip) and have one hand free. As you make an attack, you may call “disarm” once. This produces a disarm effect, replacing the damage that your attack would normally deal—and it will work whether the enemy blocks it or not, since hitting a weapon or shield can also be part of the plan. If you get through your enemy’s defenses or strike their weapon, then that enemy’s weapon is disarmed; if you hit a shield instead, then that shield is disarmed. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of DISARM you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Feint,1*,-,"As a duelist, you have learned how to fool your enemies into thinking that they must expend energy to defend themselves in places you never meant to hit. You may only use this skill if you are wielding a “short” or “one-handed” weapon (that is, a melee weapon that is 48 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip) and have one hand free. When you use any skill, spell, or bestowed ability to produce a damaging call with a melee attack—such as using 5-DAMAGE STRIKE, DISARM, or BLADE CASTING a spell—and your opponent calls “dodge” or “parry” to cancel your attack, you may immediately call “feint” to regain the use of your special attack. Essentially, this means that your opponent has expended one use of their defensive skill, but you have not expended any uses of your offensive skill or ability. If you were using BLADE CASTING, you retain the mana used to power the spell you were casting. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of FEINT you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills"
Invoke Challenge,5,-,"As a duelist, you enjoy the thrill of combat and are energized by the opportunity to focus yourself on a formal test of your prowess. INVOKE CHALLENGE gives you the ability to challenge an opponent (or multiple opponents at once) to a duel; if they accept, then during that duel you may use any of your skills that have the “Returns With: Rest” property as though you were fully rested. The challenge that you invoke must be verbal, it must include the word “challenge” specifically, and it has no effect if your opponent(s) do not accept that challenge in a clear-cut and obvious way. If you issue your challenge to multiple opponents, only those who accept will be considered part of the duel. Once you are in a duel, you may use your “Returns With: Rest” skills as though you were fully rested—but only within the confines of the duel. You cannot knowingly use any such skills on targets other than yourself and your duel opponent(s). In fact, the duel is broken if you or your opponents attack anyone outside the confines of the duel, and it is also broken if anyone outside the duel attacks you or your opponents. Even if there is no interference, the duel does not necessarily have to end with your or your opponents’ death: it also ends if all duelists but one surrender or are incapacitated."
Salute,4,-,"As a duelist, you find that giving your opponents a gesture of respect helps you to focus on the fight and therefore enhances your ability to avoid harm. At any point during or immediately before combat, you may perform an elaborate flourish with your weapon, ending in a salute to your opponent. This process should take at least 3 seconds; when you finish, though, you immediately gain 3 points of temporary armor. Because this armor value is not technically “bestowed,” it can stack with other sources of temporary armor, and enemies must work through these 3 points before they can deal normal damage to your other armor or Health Points.  Unfortunately, though, this temporary armor value will also be removed (if it has not already been broken through) as soon as the current battle is finished."
Stylish Hat,2,"Salute","As a duelist, you understand that fighting is always more worthwhile when you can look fabulous while doing it. To use this skill, you must be wearing an impressive hat of some kind. If you are, then whenever you use the Salute skill you gain 5 temporary armor points instead of 3."
Cloak Fighting,6,-,"As a duelist, you have learned that misdirection and cleverness are often just as good as plate mail. To use this skill, you must be wearing a cloak of some variety. If you are, then you can use that cloak as a kind of shield: any physical attack that hits your cloak (and does not immediately hit a part of your body behind the cloak) is blocked by the cloak and will have no effect. That is, if you are using an arm to hold your cloak out to block a low attack, you will take damage if that attack hits your arm (whether it is in front of or behind the cloak), but you will not take any damage if the attack merely impacts your cloak. Of course, you wouldn’t take any damage in that circumstance even without this skill, and therefore this skill may initially seem useless—that is, anyone hitting your cloak could theoretically just keep pushing through until they hit some part of you underneath. In Twin Mask’s combat system, though, players are not allowed to “muscle through” another person’s guard. The rules of the game mean that enemies have to respect your cloak as a defensive option. Naturally, those same rules mean that you must use your cloak with safety in mind: you may not grapple weapons with your cloak, and you may not use it as a net or snare for tripping people. And, of course, any spell packets hitting your cloak will have their full effect on you, just as they would when hitting a more conventional shield."
Witty Repartee,7,-,"As a duelist, you know the role of a well-placed boast or taunt in the midst of combat. To use this skill, you must first compliment yourself or cleverly insult your opponent’s fighting prowess. Such banter should consist of at least a complete sentence or two, and it should take at least 3 seconds. If you meet these requirements, you may have your next physical attack deal 2 extra damage beyond what it would normally deal, as long as that attack is made within 30 seconds of your witty banter. WITTY REPARTEE can only be used during combat, and although it can be used as often as desired, you must make a distinct boast or taunt between each damageboosted attack."
Pure of Heart,3,"Special","As a duelist, you have pledged your service and your devotion to a lady or a gentleman, such that you wear their favor and dedicate your deeds to their honor and glory. In order to take this skill, you must have chosen an individual person that your character will seek to defend, praise, and obey. This person is generally an idealized lover, but they could also be a family member, a leader, or some other person who is ideologically very important to your character. You must also have a physical object (perhaps a ribbon or a badge) that is meaningfully symbolic of this person’s favor. As long as you continue to role-play true devotion to this chosen person, and as long as you actively wear their favor, you may treat PURE OF HEART as functionally identical to the WILLPOWER skill. PURE OF HEART is cheaper, of course, but it can only be taken once, and it comes with significant role-playing requirements."

# The School of Suffering #
###########################
Armored Forearms,6,-,"Through intense training and discipline, you have shaped your forearms into shields: their incredibly toughened skin and dense bone are strong enough to stop a blade. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor or using any shields, and you may only wield thrown weapons, a bow, or short weapons (which are melee weapons 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip). As long as you meet those conditions, you may use your forearms exactly as though they were shields, with the exception that touch-delivered attacks like PRESSURE POINT: STUN ARM will still affect you. All weapon attacks that hit your forearms will have no effect, but, importantly, you are still vulnerable to the BREAK ARM skill."
Armored Shins,9,-,"Through intense training and discipline, you have shaped your shins and feet into shields: their incredibly toughened skin and dense bone are strong enough to stop a blade. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor or using any shields, and you may only wield thrown weapons, a bow, or short weapons (which are melee weapons 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip). As long as you meet those conditions, you may use your shins and feet exactly as though they were shields, with the exception that touch-delivered attacks like PRESSURE POINT: STUN LEG will still affect you. All weapon attacks that hit your forearms will have no effect, but, importantly, you are still vulnerable to the BREAK LEG skill."
Pressure Point: Stun Arm,2*,-,"You have studied the way that energy flows through the body, and as a result you have learned how to touch an opponent’s arm in a way that will make that specific limb go entirely numb for a few seconds. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor. As long as you meet that condition, you may deliver a single touch attack to an enemy’s arm and call “stun arm,” making the arm you touched useless for 3 seconds. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of PRESSURE POINT: STUN ARM you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Pressure Point: Stun Leg,2*,-,"You have studied the way that energy flows through the body, and as a result you have learned how to touch an opponent’s leg in a way that will make that specific limb go entirely numb for a few seconds. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor. As long as you meet that condition, you may deliver a single touch attack to an enemy’s leg and call “stun leg,” making the leg you touched useless for 3 seconds. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of PRESSURE POINT: STUN LEG you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Pressure Point: Lesser Sleep,4*,-,"You have studied the way that energy flows through the body, and as a result you have learned how to touch unguarded opponents in a way that will shut down their consciousness for a few minutes. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor. As long as you meet that condition, you may deliver a single touch attack to any part of an enemy’s body and call “lesser sleep,” making them fall into unconsciousness for a full 3 minutes. Keep in mind that, since this is a “Lesser” effect, it will not work on any Returned or other “major” characters. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of PRESSURE POINT: LESSER SLEEP you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Slow Bleeding,3,-,"Through a meditative process that brings you to the brink of death, you have learned how to regulate your heartbeat and increase the length of time it takes to bleed to death. Without this skill, the process of bleeding out takes 3 minutes; this skill increases that amount by 3 minutes, up to a total of 6."
Meditative Stillness,2,"Slow Bleeding","Through your increasing mastery of the art of meditation, you have learned how to control not just your heartbeat but also many of your body’s other functions, to the point that you can achieve utter stillness. Even in the midst of great pain, you can make your vital signs fall to a state indistinguishable from death. Though you are still susceptible to TORTURE and other painbased effects, whenever a skill or spell attempts to determine if you are alive, you may choose to answer “no.”"
Slow Death,3,"Meditative Stillness","Through a meditative process that has let you mentally explore the borderlands of death, you have learned how to force your spirit to remain a bit longer in the realm of the living. Without this skill, your allies have 3 minutes after your death in which to use resurrection magic on you; this skill increases that amount by 3 minutes, up to a total of 6."
Torture Resistance,3*,-,"Whether it is through natural toughness, meditative prowess, or just exposure to a lot of pain, you have started to develop the fortitude needed to keep your secrets to yourself while being tortured. When an enemy uses the TORTURE skill and asks you a question, you may call “resist” rather than answering. (See the TORTURE skill for more details on the process of torture.) If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of TORTURE RESISTANCE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Torture Immunity,4,"Torture Resistance x3","Through painful experience and the drive to push your willpower until it is truly iron-clad, you have become so resistant to torture that you will never tell your tormentors anything you don’t want to. When an enemy uses the TORTURE skill and asks you a question, you may call “no effect” rather than answering. (See the TORTURE skill for more details on the process of torture.)"

Stealth Attack,6,"Short Weapons","You have learned the art of attacking your unsuspecting enemies with both precision and silence, striking in such a way as to leave them with no options but to die. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor, and you may only wield short weapons (which are melee weapons 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip). As long as you meet those conditions, you may call “stealth” immediately before any melee attack you make on someone whose back is turned. As long as your attack lands on your enemy’s back, they cannot use PARRY or DODGE to cancel the effects of that attack."
10-Damage Strike,8*,"Short Weapons","You know how to strike with surgical precision, dealing a devastating amount of damage not through brute force but through unerring accuracy. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor, and you may only wield short weapons (which are melee weapons 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip). As long as you meet those conditions while you make a physical ranged or melee attack, you may choose to have that attack deal a base amount of 10 damage (and therefore call “10”). If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of 10-DAMAGE STRIKE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Studied Killer,6,"Stealth Attack","You have mastered the art of hiding in plain sight, not letting your enemies know your real plans until it is far too late. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor, and you may only wield short weapons (which are melee weapons 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip).  Additionally, you must stay within arm’s reach (roughly 3 feet) of your target for at least 30 seconds. Once that time has elapsed, assuming you meet the other conditions, you may call “stealth” immediately before your next melee attack against that target. That is, as long as you have been close enough for long enough, you may make a stealth attack from plain sight, even if you are right in front of your target. As with the STEALTH ATTACK skill, that target cannot use PARRY or DODGE to cancel the effects of the attack"
Twist the Knife,10,"Stealth Attack, 10-Damage Strike","You have learned how to really make your stealth attacks hurt—you can take a powerful blow and really grind it into your foe, turning merely “impressive” damage into something truly lethal.  If you have this skill, the damage you deal with the 3-DAMAGE STRIKE and/or 5-DAMAGE STRIKE skills is automatically enhanced, as long as you are using that skill in conjunction with the STEALTH ATTACK skill. With TWIST THE KNIFE, a 3-DAMAGE STRIKE’s base damage is improved to 5, and a 5-DAMAGE STRIKE’s base damage is improved to 10."
Poisoned Ring,4,"Stealth Attack, Lore: Alchemy","You have studied not only the complex ways that poisons interact with the body, but also the most artful ways to administer them to the unsuspecting. To use this skill, you must be wearing a ring on one of your hands. As long as you are not already in combat with your target, you may choose to touch them with your ring-bearing hand and deliver a powerful time-release poison, calling “0 poison 10.” This means that the target will not take any damage immediately, but they will be aware that they have been poisoned, they will probably not be happy about your treachery…and, in 30 seconds, they will take 10 damage."
Shin Kick,3*,"Stun","You know how to surprise a foe with a sudden attack, extending the advantage that the element of surprise gives you. That—or maybe you just like kicking people. As long as you are not already in combat with your target, you may use this skill to deliver a touch attack and call “stun,” making your target ineffective and reeling for 3 seconds. For safety reasons, you should not actually kick anyone, but you are encouraged to pantomime a kick at the same time that you deliver the touch attack. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of SHIN KICK you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Sand In Your Eyes,3*,"Stun","You have learned to take any advantage you can get in a fight, and you are not ashamed if that advantage involves chucking some sand into your enemy’s face. When you use this skill, you may throw a spell packet at an opponent and call “stun,” knocking them reeling for 3 seconds if the packet connects. The spell packet is meant to simulate a handful of sand or dirt—but Twin Mask rules prohibit throwing packets at people’s faces, so you will have to throw it to hit them elsewhere. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of SAND IN YOUR EYES you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Hidden Weapon,3,"Short Weapons","When you have been through a lot of fights with a short weapon like a dagger, you start to think of it as an indispensable friend. When people insist that you leave your friend behind while you go to a party, you might want to sneak it in anyway—after all, that dagger has saved your life, and it might be necessary to take a life, too. In order to use HIDDEN WEAPON, you must make a good-faith attempt to conceal a short weapon (which must be 20 inches or shorter, from pommel to tip). As long as you make more than just a token effort, you may successfully stash your weapon just about anywhere: inside an article of your clothing, in a box, under a pillow, inside a birthday cake, etc. Once you have hidden it, you may tie a white headband around that short weapon, indicating that it is officially “hidden.” Such a hidden weapon cannot be detected by other people through any non-magical means; player characters and non-player characters alike will have to role-play not seeing it. With this skill, only 1 weapon at a time can be concealed; additionally, the weapon will automatically move along with whatever article of clothing (or cake, etc.) it is hidden within, unless you choose to move it separately. In order to retrieve the weapon from its hiding place, you must be able to reach it and remove the white headband; if your hands are bound with shackles or the ROPE USE skill, you will be unable to do so."
Leap,2*,-,"You have practiced your acrobatic skills to the point that you can occasionally take to the air, leaping over people’s heads in order to move yourself to a better tactical position. To use this skill, you must not be wearing any armor. When you use this skill, you raise your hands above your head (which is a signal that you are now airborne) and immediately take 3 steps in a row, to show the distance of your jump. Those steps can be as large as you can make them, but they must be immediate: you cannot delay your steps in order to get increased “air time.” At the end of those three steps, you must role-play the process of landing from a high jump, with at least 3 limbs touching the ground (most people will do a “superhero landing” with 2 feet and 1 hand on the ground). While you are taking your 3 steps with your hands raised, you cannot take any actions or use any skills—but you also cannot be affected by any attacks or spells that can be physically dodged (that is, attacks that could be canceled by the DODGE skill). You can still be affected, however, by attacks delivered by voice, gaze, gesture, or ward. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of LEAP you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Leap Attack,3*,"Leap","You have continued training your acrobatic skills, but with a focus on actual combat: you have learned how to use your momentum and height to make an attack in the midst of your incredible leaps. With this skill, whenever you use the LEAP skill, you may make 1 basic melee attack (or use one skill that produces a single melee attack, such as 5-DAMAGE STRIKE or DISARM) during the time you spend “airborne.”"
Rope Use,3,-,"You have learned the properties of various kinds of rope, and you have mastered the art of using knots to bind people in a legitimately secure way. Without this skill, any effort that you make to bind somebody with ropes will be shaky at best, and that person will be able to escape if they push themselves to do so (people untrained in ROPE USE should probably use shackles for this purpose). If you have this skill, though, you can spend 3 seconds role-playing the process of tying a person up, using a physical representation of a rope or rope-like object (such as an actual rope, a belt, a long strip of cloth, etc.)—and if you do, those bonds will appropriately restrict the subject’s movement as though they were truly restrained. This means that, if their legs are bound together, they will not be able to separate them; if their arms or hands are bound, they will be unable to do anything requiring freedom of movement in their arms (such as, for instance, retrieving weapons they may have stashed with the HIDDEN WEAPON skill). The only ways to escape one’s bonds are to use the ESCAPE skill, to spend 3 seconds cutting your bonds (if your hands are free and you can wield a bladed weapon), or to have somebody else spend 3 seconds cutting your bonds with a bladed weapon. When you use this skill, while you are role-playing the 3 seconds of binding your subject, you should briefly explain how it works."

# The Honored Path of the Beserker #
####################################
Battle Rage,7*,-,"You have mastered the art of accepting your anger as it courses through you, giving you the ability to strike with more ferocity than other people are capable of. To use this skill, you must first let loose a powerful scream of fury, then officially call “rage.” This starts a 10-second period during which all of your attacks will do a base amount of 3 damage, enabling you to call “3” for each such attack. During this period, you should role-play being in a state of unreasoning anger, with very little control over your own destructive impulses. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of BATTLE RAGE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Enduring Rage,6,-,"You are a warrior who has learned to draw inspiration, or perhaps just fuel for the fire of your rage, from the defeat and death of your enemies: whenever you ceremoniously kill an enemy in combat, you give yourself some motivation (in the form of Health Points) to help keep you going. To use this skill, you should take roughly 3 seconds to speak to an enemy that you personally put into a helpless or bleeding-out state, either to taunt them or to say a few words to honor them. If you do, and then administer a deathblow to them, you may call “heal self 2.” Although the game treats this as a normal healing effect, you should role-play it as adrenaline instead: your wounds have not closed or vanished, but you are nonetheless still pushing forward to fight."
Brutal Anger,5,-,"You have become adept at reaching deep within your own rage and drawing forth the energy needed to make your attacks strong enough to send your enemies flying. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of getting incredibly angry for 3 full seconds, focusing on expressing your rage without making any attacks or using any skills. Then, immediately after those 3 seconds, you may add the Massive effect to the next attack you make, which will therefore knock your target back 3 steps, even if they block or PARRY your attack."
Hatred,4,"Battle Rage","Your drive to wade into combat is so strong, and your anger is such a powerful force, that you can rely on that instinct to pull you to your feet for one last push, even if you are suffering from extreme weakness. To use this skill, you must role-play some kind of savage self-motivation effort—for instance, letting out a howl or screaming and hitting yourself in the chest. If you do, you gain the opportunity to immediately use the BATTLE RAGE skill and, if you do, to remove any Weakness effects currently affecting you. This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot use any skills while suffering from Weakness. (If you do not have any more uses of BATTLE RAGE available, then HATRED has no effect.)"
Seething Hatred,4,"Hatred","You have practiced unleashing your anger in combat so much that you can conjure that same energy and heat even in quieter moments, when you feel weak and need to get back onto your feet. To use this skill, you must role-play some kind of savage self-motivation effort—for instance, letting out a howl or screaming and hitting yourself in the chest. Whenever you do, you may remove any Weakness effects currently affecting you. This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot use any skills while suffering from Weakness. Afterward, you should roleplay being extremely angry until combat has subsided and you get a chance to calm down."
Berserker,10,"Seething Hatred","You have finally reached the pinnacle of savage combat, gaining the ability to shrug off even the deadliest wounds through the sheer force of your rage. You may only use this skill once per game—and, to do so, you must have entered a bleedout state within the last 30 seconds. (This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot use any skills while suffering from Weakness.) If you choose to use this skill during that time, you call “berserker!”, which immediately causes the following effects: 1) you are healed to your normal, maximum Health Point total, which ends your “bleedout” condition; 2) you end any Weakness effects that are affecting you; 3) you gain the Berserk effect, which means that you will attack whoever is closest to you, friend or foe, in a blind rage for 3 minutes; and 4) all physical attacks you make during the duration of that Berserk effect will deal a base amount of 3 damage (and you may therefore call “3”), unless you are using an attack that has a higher base damage. When the Berserk effect ends in any way, you automatically lose all of your current HP and drop into bleedout again. (Start a new bleedout count, rather than continuing the previous one.)"
Break Arm,5*,-,"You have mastered the art of summoning up a lot of strength and unleashing it on a single foe— not just to cause indiscriminate damage, but to specifically snap a bone in their arm and ruin their ability to fight. When you use this skill, you make a physical melee attack and call “break arm.” If you hit your enemy on any part of either arm, then you have broken that specific arm, and they will be unable to use that limb until the bone can be set. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of BREAK ARM you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Break Leg,5*,-,"You have mastered the art of summoning up a lot of strength and unleashing it on a single foe— not just to cause indiscriminate damage, but to specifically snap a bone in their leg and ruin their ability to move around. When you use this skill, you make a physical melee attack and call “break leg.” If you hit your enemy on any part of either leg, then you have broken that specific leg, and they will be unable to use that limb until the bone can be set. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of BREAK LEG you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Break Shield,5*,"Two-handed Weapons","You have mastered the art of summoning up a lot of strength and unleashing it on a single, welldefended foe—not just to cause indiscriminate damage, but to specifically shatter their shield and “open them up” to other attacks. When you use this skill, you make a physical melee attack with a two-handed weapon (that is, a weapon that is longer than 48 inches from pommel to tip) and call “break shield.” If you hit your enemy on any part of their shield, then that shield becomes broken, making it unusable until it can be repaired by a smith. If a player cannot drop their shield to the ground immediately, they can simply hold that shield off to the side rather than using it. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of BREAK SHIELD you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."

Examine Wounds,2,-,"You have some basic training in the medical arts, such that you can look at a person and get a fairly accurate sense of just how injured they are in specific terms. You have the ability to call “examine wounds” whenever you are within arm’s reach (roughly 3 feet) of your chosen subject.  They must tell you if they are living, bleeding out, or dead; if they are not bleeding out or dead, they should also tell you exactly how damaged they are, in numerical terms. (For instance, “I am missing 4 HP.”) If you spend at least 3 seconds touching your subject, you may also determine if any of their prosthetics (such as pointed ears, horns, a tail, or a longer nose) are legitimate parts of their body. This is useful in attempting to see through the effects of the MASTER DISGUISE skill: although there are certain spells or magical items that can obfuscate the results of EXAMINE WOUNDS, a subject without any such magical effects will be forced to truthfully point out whether any prosthetics “don’t feel alive” (and are therefore part of a disguise) or not. See the DISGUISE skill for more information about how disguises generally work in Twin Mask."
Detect Poison,2,"Examine Wounds","You have some significant training in the medical arts, such that you can look at a person and determine if they have been poisoned or not. You have the ability to call “detect poison” whenever you are within arm’s reach (roughly 3 feet) of your chosen subject. They must tell you if they are suffering from the effects of a poison—but, unfortunately, they cannot tell you the specific effects of any poisons in their system. This skill only works when it is used on people: you cannot use DETECT POISON to determine if a food, drink, or residue contains poison (see the ALCHEMICAL EXAMINATION skill). If you are involved in an investigation of possible poisons, though, you should mention that your character has the DETECT POISON skill, since Twin Mask staff members might decide to give you some extra information as a result."
Detect Disease,2,"Examine Wounds","You have some significant training in the medical arts, such that you can look at a person and determine if they are suffering from a disease. You have the ability to call “detect disease” whenever you are within arm’s reach (roughly 3 feet) of your chosen subject. They must tell you if they have a disease in their system—but, unfortunately, they cannot tell you the specific effects of any diseases they may be suffering from. This skill only works when it is used on people: you cannot use DETECT DISEASE to determine if a food or drink harbors a disease. If you are involved in an investigation of possible diseases, though, you should mention that your character has the DETECT DISEASE skill, since Twin Mask staff members might decide to give you some extra information as a result."
Apply Pressure,1,"Examine Wounds","You have some significant training in the medical arts, such that you can apply the right kind of first-aid pressure to help stop a person from bleeding out for quite some time. With this skill, you have the ability to call “slow bleeding” whenever you are touching a person who is in bleedout.  As long as you maintain physical contact with the subject, you can halt their bleedout count—but you can only use APPLY PRESSURE in this way for up to 3 minutes, after which their bleedout count will continue from where you paused it. For each person, you only get 3 minutes of APPLY PRESSURE, even if that 3 minutes is broken up into smaller periods of contact; that is, there is no way to “reset” a subject’s bleedout count with this skill."
Set Bone,3,"Apply Presure","You have advanced training in the medical arts, such that you can determine how a person’s bone is broken, by feel, and then shift that bone back into its proper position to allow it to begin healing. With this skill, you have the ability to call “set bone” whenever you are touching a person who has a broken limb. You should role-play the process of wrenching the limb into place, and the subject should role-play an enormous amount of pain during the process. In fact, whenever you use this ability, you should call “stun by pain” immediately afterward, as the subject is completely unable to do anything for 3 seconds. After a limb is repaired in this way, the subject still cannot start using it immediately; for the next 3 minutes that limb is considered “maimed,” which means that it cannot be used for anything even slightly strenuous."
Bandage,4,"Set Bone","You have advanced training in the medical arts, such that you can apply bandages to wounded people with enough skill to significantly improve their health. With this skill, you have the ability to tie a strip of cloth around a subject’s arm or leg, then call “heal 1” to restore 1 Health Point. After a subject has been bandaged, you may not use BANDAGE to heal them again until they are actually wounded again, or until the original bandage has been removed safely (after at least 30 minutes). When either of those conditions are met, though, you can tie another bandage onto the subject and call “heal 1” again. This skill works on any living subject, and it can save someone from bleeding out, but you do actually need to have a strip of fabric that can serve as a bandage. As mentioned earlier, after you use this ability, the subject must wear the bandage for at least 30 minutes; if the bandage is removed before that time, the subject will take, in 3 minutes, an amount of damage equal to the number of bandages they were wearing before you removed one. (The exception to this rule is magical healing: if magic is used to bring the subject to full health, then bandages may be removed prematurely without causing any damage.)"
Surgery,5,"Bandage, Lore: Anatomy","You have master-level training in the medical arts, such that you can perform a wide range of complex surgical procedures without permanently damaging your subjects. SURGERY is, in fact, something of a catch-all skill—any kind of high-difficulty medical procedures (such as reattaching limbs, removing invasive parasites, or grafting materials into a subject’s body) fall under the purview of this skill, and the range of such procedures is limited only by your imagination and the opportunities that occur within the game. SURGERY is often best used alongside healing magic of some variety; for instance, simply using this skill to reattach a severed limb will not make that limb useable unless healing magic can restore its functionality.  To use this skill, you must have props representing a doctor’s implements, such as (for example) a needle and thread, a sharp knife, and a magnifying glass. The amount of time required to perform a given surgery will vary by its complexity (ask a Twin Mask staff member for details), but many will take 3 minutes of intensive role-playing. Additionally, the SURGERY skill can be used to drain blood from dead (or wounded) creatures or people, and it can be used to harvest useful parts of the bodies of various unusual creatures, if you can begin the surgical process very soon after their deaths."
Prayer,4,-,"You have learned how to focus your mind and soul into a quiet stillness that can help your thoughts echo outward into the realm of the divine. To use this skill, you must spend 30 minutes actively praying to a god of your choice, ideally at a place of worship (most likely a shrine) dedicated to that god. After this 30-minute period, you may approach Twin Mask staff and describe your prayer. After considering many factors—including what your character is asking of the god, your character’s intentions, your character’s past relationship with the god, and the current cosmological conditions—Twin Mask staff will inform you whether the god intends to honor your plea, ignore it, or become angry as a result of it. Occasionally, you may instead get a direct response from the god, either verbally or in the form of a vision. The PRAYER skill can only be used once per game."
Repentence,2,-,"You have recognized the depth of the mistakes you made in the past, and all you wish is to be understood and forgiven as a person seeking redemption. In order to take this skill, you must role-play deep and sincere repentance for your character’s evil actions in the past. Taking this skill reduces your character’s “Taint score” by 1. (See the “Taint” section of Chapter 12 for more details on Taint as a game mechanic.) Of course, you must also continue to role-play an active desire to make up for your previous actions, and if you ever again do something evil enough to warrant gaining a point of Taint, you will receive 1 additional Taint as a kind of punishment."

Mana Focus,1*,"Magical Aptitude","You have recognized the depth of the mistakes you made in the past, and all you wish is to be understood and forgiven as a person seeking redemption. In order to take this skill, you must role-play deep and sincere repentance for your character’s evil actions in the past. Taking this skill reduces your character’s “Taint score” by 1.

Apprentice Magic,6,"Mana Focus x5, Lore: (Same Magical Art)","You have recognized the depth of the mistakes you made in the past, and all you wish is to be understood and forgiven as a person seeking redemption. In order to take this skill, you must role-play deep and sincere repentance for your character’s evil actions in the past. Taking this skill reduces your character’s “Taint score” by 1.

Of course, you must also continue to role-play an active desire to make up for your previous actions, and if you ever again do something evil enough to warrant gaining a point of Taint, you will receive 1 additional Taint as a kind of punishment."
Journeyman Magic,6,"Mana Focus x10, Apprentice Magic: (Same Magical Art)","By standing atop the building blocks of a particular magical art (such as Warding or Alchemy) you have learned how to produce more complex effects associated with that art, as long as you have the appropriate scrolls. That is, you can cast 2nd-level spells of that magical art. Each time you take this skill, you choose a different magical art that you have already learned at the Apprentice level."
Master Magic,6,"Mana Focus x15, Journeyman Magic: (Same Magical Art)","By delving even deeper into the mysteries and practical challenges of a particular magical art (such as Sorcery or Warding) you have begun to harness some of the fundamentally powerful aspects of that art—as long as you have the appropriate scrolls. That is, you can cast 3rd-level spells of that magical art. Each time you take this skill, you choose a different magical art that you have already learned at the Journeyman level."
Grandmaster Magic,6,"Mana Focus x20, Master Magic: (Same Magical Art)","Whether it is through intensive study or powerful intuition, you have begun to exceed the limits of your teachers’ knowledge of a particular magical art (such as Channeling or Alchemy) and are now capable of delving into its most arcane depths…as long as you have the appropriate scrolls.  That is, you can cast 4th-level spells of that magical art. Each time you take this skill, you choose a different magical art that you have already learned at the Master level."
Blade Casting,8,"Magical Aptitude","You have blended two strengths—martial discipline and arcane focus—into a powerful ability: you can make the magical effects of your spells flow through whatever weapon you are wielding. With this skill, any spell you can cast that would normally be delivered by packet can instead be delivered with a swing of your weapon, with the effect of the spell replacing the damage of your attack. You must still spend the mana for the spell, along with spending the amount of time casting the spell would normally take (so, for instance, if you cast a 4th-level spell in this way, it will have to be at least 4 seconds after the last spell you cast). Unlike spells that are delivered by packet, though, spells delivered this way will not work if they hit an opponent’s shield or weapon."
Armored Casting,6,"Magical Aptitude","Through long training and discipline, you have learned how to draw on mana even with the hardened barrier of armor dulling your connection to the world’s magic. You may cast spells while wearing armor."
Shield Casting,6,"Magical Aptitude","Through practice with the magical arts and improving your dexterity, you have learned how to draw on mana even while holding a heavy, inert chunk of wood or metal. You may cast spells while wielding a shield."
Combat Mimic,4*,"Blade Casting","You have developed the hard-to-explain ability to feel the ‘energy swirls’ that are caused by powerful or unusual melee attacks used in close proximity to you. By using your familiarity with BLADE CASTING, you can watch an enemy closely and mimic any weapon-delivered melee attack they perform against you, even if that attack is far beyond your normal capabilities. Immediately after an enemy attempts to strike you with such an attack, if you are wielding a melee weapon, you may call “mimic” as you make a retaliatory attack, followed by the exact same call that the enemy used for their attack. (The only weapon-based melee attacks that you cannot mimic are those that use the “Greater” modifier.) If you have multiple uses of COMBAT MIMIC, you can make multiple such attacks in a row, all based on the initial attack against you. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Internal Reserves,4,"Mana Focus x10","As a spellcaster, you have learned how to tap into your inner wells of magical power, and, in times of great need, you can even pour an unhealthy amount of your strength into your magical arts. Whenever you choose to use this ability, you must meditate (remaining motionless, with your eyes closed) for 30 seconds. If you do, you can reduce your maximum Health Point total by 1 for the next 3 days in order to immediately call “restore 10 mana” (thereby regaining 10 mana).  This reduction in maximum HP total cannot be healed through any normal means, and if you reduce your maximum HP total to 0 in this way, you immediately die."
Arcane Tutelage,10,"Grandmaster Magic: (Any Magical Art), Research","After so much time spent doing magical research and perfecting the art of your spellcasting, you have accumulated a great deal of useful information and advice to share with your fellow magicusers.  Once per game, you can spend 30 minutes role-playing through a “magic class” with as many spellcasters as are interested in participating, thereby bestowing on them a special, longlasting boon of 10 additional mana. The 30-minute ARCANE TUTELAGE class itself can focus on any magic-related or scholarly activities, including lectures or moderated discussions (on abstract magical theory, cosmology, recent arcane events, etc.) or possibly field excursions (involving packet-throwing, healing, herbalism, leylines, etc.). At the end of the class, you may call “bestow 10 mana” to affect all other characters (that is, everyone but you) that were involved in the full duration of the class. If an ARCANE TUTELAGE session is interrupted by unplanned combat, the class does not need to restart—as long as you return to class with a gap of no more than 3 minutes after the end of combat, you can resume the class where you left off.  Importantly, the extra 10 mana bestowed by ARCANE TUTELAGE lasts for 3 full days, with the added bonus that it will replenish at sunrise and sunset, just as normal mana generated by the MANA FOCUS skill does. In order to gain any benefit from ARCANE TUTELAGE, a character must be a “spellcaster,” which means that they must have taken at least 1 APPRENTICE MAGIC skill.  This must be a formal class; merely engaging in casual conversation about magic-related subjects is not sufficient to meet this skill’s requirements. Twin Mask staff encourages players who take this skill to use visual aides and require their students to take notes, or perhaps even to make their students do “homework.”"

Disguise,4,-,"You have learned enough about the art of disguise to be able to convince others of your assumed identity through your mannerisms and confidence, even if your appearance is less than completely accurate. Twin Mask costuming and characters rely on a suspension of disbelief, which can make in-game disguises complicated. For instance, if you normally present yourself as female in daily life, but you decide to play a male character in Twin Mask, other players will role-play as though your character is unambiguously male, ignoring their knowledge of your real-life female identity. This willingness to “role-play along” with a character’s intended appearance can make disguises too effective, actually: if you dress up like a Mandalan, for instance, people are generally right to assume that you are playing a new, Mandalan character rather than just your old character in new, Mandalan clothing. To manage the trickiness of this distinction, any player may, at any time, raise a fist above their head (to signal going momentarily out-of-character) and ask another player, “do I recognize you as [character name]?” If you are playing the named character in different clothing, you must answer “yes” to such a question. This is where the DISGUISE skill comes into play: with this skill, you may answer “no” instead. Importantly, though, because prosthetics such as Effendal ears, demon horns, and so on are quite advanced pieces of costuming in the world of Twin Mask, you are not allowed to use such prosthetics as part of your character’s disguise."
Master Disguise,6,"Disguise","You have mastered the art of disguise, to the point that you can acquire and use incredibly lifelike prosthetics as part of your disguises, allowing you to masquerade as a member of a different species. See the DISGUISE skill for more information about how disguises generally work in Twin Mask; if you have the MASTER DISGUISE skill, the restriction on prosthetics as part of your costume no longer applies. You will still have to supply your own prosthetics if you want your character to use them (outside of rare cases in which you might be able to convince Twin Mask staff to loan you prosthetics)."
Escape,3*,-,"You are an escape artist, with the practice needed to squirm your way out of any kinds of ropes, chains, shackles, or grappling holds that others might use to try to pin you down. When you use this skill, you call “escape” and may instantly pull yourself free from any kinds of bonds or snares that were trapping your character (including any Bind effects caused by, for instance, The Binding Spell). You can similarly pull yourself out of any character’s grip, even if they are using the Strength ability to hold you. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of ESCAPE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Poison Resistance,2*,-,"You have been exposed to poisons enough that you have started to develop a tolerance to their effects. When you use this skill, you call “resist” and immediately end any poison effects that are currently affecting your character. This call may be made at any point during a poison count— but, importantly, it can also be made in response to a poison effect, so that you do not have to take the initial effect of that poison. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of POISON RESISTANCE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Poison Immunity,4,"Poison Resistance x3","After constant exposure to poisons, whether as the result of an organized effort on your part or simply through bad luck, you have built up a complete immunity to their effects. Whenever a poison would affect you, you may instead call “no effect.”"
Disarm Traps,5,-,"You have learned how to spot traps and, given a bit of time, how to use the appropriate tools to disarm them. In Twin Mask, traps consist of small explosive caps that, when disturbed, snap open and make a loud sound, dealing 5 damage to everyone within a small radius. Generally, people use string, tape, and other, similar materials to link those caps to objects that they don’t want disturbed. Without this skill, even if you notice a trap before you trigger it, you have no choice to but to avoid it (or just trigger it and take the damage). If you have this skill, though, you can attempt to physically disarm the trap by using any tools that you carry with you.  Generally, this means that people with the DISARM TRAPS skill will carry a set of “thieves’ tools” (small scissors, a mirror, a dentist’s hook, needle-nose pliers, etc.) so that they will be more likely to be able to handle any traps they encounter."
Set Traps,2*,"Disarm Traps","Considering all your experience working with and disarming traps, you have seen plenty of ways to set them up—and now, you are becoming increasingly adept at placing them yourself. For each instance of the SET TRAPS skill you have taken, once per game you may use your own props to set up a trap anywhere you want. (That is, if you have taken this skill 3 times, you may set up 3 traps per game.) Whenever somebody triggers one of your traps, everyone within 3 feet takes 5 damage—and two traps can be set in the same spot to increase the damage to 10, although any further traps there will not provide any additional damage. The damage from traps can be resisted, perhaps through the use of certain magical items or wards, but it cannot be prevented with the DODGE, WILLPOWER, or PARRY skills. The core mechanic of each trap is a small metal housing for an explosive cap—when that housing is disturbed enough to snap open, the cap will explode with a loud crack, alerting people and signaling that anyone close enough should take the appropriate damage. In fact, if you accidentally trigger a cap while setting up a trap, you should take 5 damage yourself. Generally, you should use string, tape, or similar materials to connect the explosive caps to any containers or doors you want to keep safe, such that the traps will explode when they are opened."
Lockpicking: Apprentice,4,-,"As a student of the art of larceny, you have also begun to develop the art of picking locks. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of picking a lock (using an actual lockpick prop) for 3 minutes. Immediately afterward, you may open that lock if it is crafted at an “Apprentice” skill level. (The skill level of any given lock should be listed on its item tag.)"
Lockpicking: Journeyman,4,"Lockpicking: Apprentice","You have continued to develop the art of picking locks. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of picking a lock (using an actual lockpick prop) for 3 minutes. Immediately afterward, you may open that lock if it is crafted at a “Journeyman” skill level. (The skill level of any given lock should be listed on its item tag.)"
Lockpicking: Master,4,"Lockpicking: Journeyman","You have become truly adept at the art of picking locks. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of picking a lock (using an actual lockpick prop) for 3 minutes. Immediately afterward, you may open that lock if it is crafted at a “Master” skill level. (The skill level of any given lock should be listed on its item tag.)"
Lockpicking: Grandmaster,4,"Lockpicking: Master","You have truly mastered the art of picking locks. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of picking a lock (using an actual lockpick prop) for 3 minutes. Immediately afterward, you may open that lock if it is crafted at a “Grandmaster” skill level. (The skill level of any given lock should be listed on its item tag.)"
Gambling,2*,-,"You have developed a knack (or perhaps the manual dexterity…) for getting dice or cards to fall in your favor, when it really matters. When you are playing a game of chance, you may use this skill to re-draw one dealt hand of cards or re-roll one set of rolled dice. You cannot use the GAMBLING skill again on that hand or that roll of the dice: you are stuck with the new results, even if they are worse than your original results. Although this may seem initially like a fairly limited use of a skill, GAMBLING can also sometimes prove useful on “mods” that occur away from the main space of the Twin Mask game. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of GAMBLING you still have available, until sunset or sunrise arrives and restores your full complement of this skill."
High Roller,6,"Gambling","You have played so many games of chance that you have memorized the odds, learned your opponents’ tells, and steered yourself away from crooked games (or at least the ones that are not crooked in your favor). In order to use this skill, your character must be living in a location that has access to a tavern or a gambling hall. If so, then at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you may choose to attempt to earn money, to represent effort that your character spent on gambling between events. When you choose to use this skill, you have a two-thirds chance of making money and a one-third chance of losing money."
Torture,2*,-,"You are good at gathering information—and in the process, you have enough practice to avoid killing people while still causing them excruciating pain. To use this skill, you must role-play the process of torturing a helpless, captive character for 3 minutes. The torture can consist of any kind of pain-inducing actions you can think of, as long as they would not kill the subject or make that subject unable to speak. In order to be considered “helpless and captive,” a character must be physically restrained, unable to escape or make any attacks. After the 3 minutes of roleplaying, you may call “torture” followed by a single, yes-or-no question. The subject then has a chance to call “resist” or “no effect” (if they have the TORTURE RESISTANCE or TORTURE IMMUNITY skill), but otherwise they must answer the question truthfully. Every time you use TORTURE, you must spend another 3 minutes role-playing before asking your question. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of TORTURE you still have available, until sunset or sunrise arrives and restores your full complement of this skill."

# Knowledge #
#############
Literacy,4,-,"At some point in your past—whether as a child or just a few months ago—someone taught you the relatively high-class ability to read and write. (Particularly for the working poor, literacy is just not an affordable luxury.) With this skill, you can read in-game documents, use the in-game postal service, write notes to other characters, and produce scholarly works. Without this skill, you must role-play an inability to understand or produce text of any kind, although you can develop a mark or symbol that you can use to “sign” any necessary documents. It is important to note that spellcasting (which requires the use of spell scrolls) is entirely separable from the LITERACY skill: if you have the appropriate LORE and MAGIC skills, you can read and use spell scrolls even without LITERACY, and LITERACY does not give you the ability to read scrolls without those LORE and MAGIC skills."
Lore: (Specify Field),4*,-,"Whether deep in the library or out gathering data in the wider world, you have spent considerable time studying a particular subject. This entry for the LORE skill actually represents an enormous spread of different possible LORE skills, one for each available field of study—you can choose any of the religions, races, magical arts, creatures, trades, or other categories of Adelrune. (Importantly, however, you may not acquire LORE skills related to the cultures listed in Chapter 5. The NATIVE LORE skill fills that role.) To use this skill, you call “Bid – Lore: Poisons” (or “Bid – Lore: Leylines,” or whatever, filling in the field you have chosen) to a Twin Mask staff member, and that staff member will provide you with whatever information your character would know or remember about the matter at hand. In general, the depth of your character’s knowledge will scale with the narrowness of the field that you choose. KNOWLEDGE: ANIMALS will give you a good amount of broad knowledge, but KNOWLEDGE: BURROWING MAMMALS will give you a lot of very specific knowledge about those particular kinds of animals. Not every LORE is available to every character; you should check with a Twin Mask staff member before you attempt to take a particular LORE, to see if access is restricted."
Research,6,"Literacy","You have developed your ability to draw a great deal of useful information from any chance to spend time with primary or secondary sources of knowledge. In order to use this skill, you must have a “research object” (with the appropriate item tag) for a certain field of study, and you must have a LORE skill (or NATIVE LORE skill) that corresponds to that field of study. If those conditions are met, then you can spend 30 uninterrupted minutes role-playing the process of using that object to research the relevant subject (generally, by reading and taking notes, making charts to track correspondences, etc.). At the end of that 30-minute period, you may approach a Twin Mask staff member and ask for the important information that your character would have gathered from their efforts. This skill can only be used once per game."
Archivist,6,"Research","You are so familiar with tracking down obscure sources of information, cross-checking possible errors, and searching through dusty tomes that you can engage in research more efficiently and quickly than other people. Instead of being limited to using the RESEARCH skill only once per game, you can use it twice—but, for the second use of RESEARCH, you must have at least 2 assistants to aid you in your efforts. Although they do not need to have any particular skills in order to help, they must be present and engaged during the entire duration of the second RESEARCH skill."
Appraise,2,-,"You have always had a knack for identifying valuable objects, and as you have gained more experience, you have learned how to accurately appraise the gems, precious metals, and other treasures around you. If you have this skill, you may seek out a Twin Mask staff member at any time and ask about the relative value of an object."
Alchemical Examination,3,"Lore: Alchemy","You have studied alchemy, and you have used that knowledge to develop tests that can detect alchemical tampering with various foods and materials. When you use this skill, you must spend at least 3 minutes studying something that you suspect of harboring alchemical additives (a category that includes poisons). You can use this skill to investigate foods, drinks, surfaces (like door handles), people, dead bodies, body parts, and so on. After the 3-minute investigation period, you may find a Twin Mask staff member and ask for information about any alchemical effects that influenced your subject. The staff member may dictate that additional investigation time is needed to determine the answer to your question—but, after that added time, they will provide you with the relevant information."

Political Standing: (Rank 1-4),4*,-,"You have made influential contacts with governors, courtiers, community leaders, diplomats, and other people connected to the political processes of various nations, (sometimes) all the way up to the top. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you earn 1 Political Influence Card for each rank of POLITICAL STANDING you have.

Mining: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"You have learned the best ways to extract precious stones and metals from the earth, and you devote some of your time to delving into caves and mines in order to do so. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you may gain valuable materials based on that rank. You get 1 point for every rank of MINING, and you can spend those points to collect items based on the rates listed below. You cannot “save up” these points between different Twin Mask game sessions: if you have MINING: 3, you must spend all 3 points (for instance, on 1 Stone and 1 Quartz) or those points are wasted."
Herbalism: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"You have learned which plants in the surrounding area have value as alchemical reagents and crafting materials, and therefore you spend some of your time ranging through the countryside to find them. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you receive a number of random, valuable herbs equal to your HERBALISM rank. These herbs are useful for making potions using the STABLE ALCHEMY skill as well as for crafting various other objects with other skills. Below, there is a representative sample of various different herbs you can find with this skill—there are many more herbs than these to find. Each herb, however, will consistently have one or more of the following 11 properties: Enchantment, Enhancement, Entropic, Hallucination, Healing, Poisonous, Purification, Sedative, Spiritual, Stimulant, and Rejuvenation. When you use an herb in a potion or crafting recipe, you choose one of its properties and ignore the others."
Woodcutting: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"You know how to properly fell trees and saw them into useable planks of wood, and you spend some of your time working through the surrounding woodlands in order to do so. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you receive a number of random, valuable planks of wood equal to your WOODCUTTING rank. These planks are useful for crafting various goods and materials, as listed in the crafting skills later in this chapter. Below, there is a representative sample of various different kinds of wood you can get with this skill—there are many more kinds of wood than these. Each plank, however, will consistently have one or more of the following 5 properties: Dense, Durable, Flexible, Lightweight, and Strong. When you use a plank in a crafting recipe, you can ignore any additional properties it has beyond the ones that are called for."
Hunting: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"You are at home in the woods and fields with a bow or a spear—silent enough to ambush your prey, lethal enough to deal grievous wounds when you strike, and dogged enough to follow wounded prey if necessary. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you may gain valuable materials based on that rank.

Mercantile: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"You have learned where to get excellent prices on your purchases, where to sell different kinds of goods, and whom to talk to when you have to exchange currency or track a shipment. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you may gain valuable materials based on that rank. You get 1 point for every rank of MERCANTILE, and you can spend those points to collect items based on the rates listed below.

Entrepreneur: (Rank 1-4),3*,-,"Whether through native intelligence or dumb luck, you have found a niche in the world of business, and you have begun to make fairly good money by supplying a needed good or service to those around you. In order to take the ENTREPRENEUR skill, you must role-play the process of starting a business or trade—you can buy and sell goods as a merchant, provide metalwork as a blacksmith, sell secrets as a freelance spy, or engage in any other trade that will provide you with money. In addition to any money that you may gain in the process of role-playing your business, you gain money at the beginning of every Twin Mask game (to represent your continuing your business outside the scope of the game).

# Human-specific Skills #
#########################
Stipend: (Rank 1-4),2*,"Must be Human, plus Nobility or Military Experience","As a human with ties to one of Adelrune’s major cultures or military organizations, you are connected to wealthy people who have an interest in supporting you—as long as you stay on favorable terms with those people or organizations, you can draw a basic income from that connection. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 4. Then, at the beginning of each Twin Mask game, you earn 1 silver piece for each rank of STIPEND you have. (Silver pieces are the standard currency of Tear.)"
Unburdened,3,"Must be Human","As a human, you have a shorter memory than people of longer-lived races do, and you place greater emphasis on pushing to achieve what you can in the short term. This means that, as a Returned, your spirit is less weighed down by death and by your misdeeds—you find it easy to forgive yourself and to justify your actions. Taking this skill reduces your character’s “Taint score” by 1. (See the “Taint” section of Chapter 12 for more details on Taint as a game mechanic.)"
Good Enough,4,"Must be Human","As a human, your sense of time is much narrower than that of other races, and you are therefore much more willing to put up with things that are merely “good enough” rather than perfect. If you have this skill, you may subtract 5 minutes (to a minimum of 10 minutes) from the time required to use any of the following skills: BLACKSMITHING, WEAPONSMITHING, ARMORSMITHING, SHIELDSMITHING, LOCKSMITHING, JEWELRY CRAFTING, WAND WORKING, SCROLL SCRIBING, STABLE ALCHEMY, TAILORING, FLETCHING, or MASONRY. (That is, all crafting skills except for COOKING.)"
Pillar of the Community,2,"Must be Human","As a human, you have inherited a social drive that pushes you to think of culture as something that must be actively built and maintained rather than merely inherited or taken for granted. In order to use this skill, you must have a recognized, official position in the government or maintenance of Solace. The list of such positions is: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Ambassador, Magistrate, Sheriff, Seneschal, Steward, Executioner, Herald, Town Cryer, and member of the Guard (including both Guard Captain and rank-and-file guards). At the beginning of each Twin Mask game, if you occupy such a position, you earn either 1 Economic Influence, 1 Military Influence, 1 Academic Influence, 1 Political Influence, or 1 Underworld Influence."

############################
# Effendel-specific Skills #
############################
Effendal Senses,2,"Must be Effendal","As an Effendal, your sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell are much keener than a human’s, particularly when you are focusing intently on the natural world. Along with the opportunity for some entertaining role-playing, this skill enhances your ability to follow creatures and people using the TRACKING skill; when you use that skill, you may also call “Effendal senses” to the Twin Mask staff member who is attending your efforts, and you will receive more information than you otherwise would. You can track with no light source, you can tell the relative weights of anyone you are tracking, you can determine their speed with more accuracy, and so on."
Effendal Agility,2,"Must be Effendal","As an Effendal, you are light on your feet and can perform acrobatic maneuvers that would be impossible for people of any other race. Along with the opportunity for some entertaining roleplaying, this skill enhances your use of the LEAP skill. Whenever you use LEAP, you may take 4 total steps to represent the distance of your jump, rather than just 3. "
Patience,4,"Must be Effendal","As an Effendal, you have extra time in which to focus on any crafts that you decide to learn.  With this skill, you may choose to double the amount of time required to use any of the following skills: BLACKSMITHING, WEAPONSMITHING, ARMORSMITHING, SHIELDSMITHING, LOCKSMITHING, JEWELRY CRAFTING, WAND WORKING, SCROLL SCRIBING, COOKING, STABLE ALCHEMY, TAILORING, FLETCHING, or MASONRY. (That is, all crafting skills.) If you do, then you may use the appropriate skill as though you were 1 level more accomplished than you actually are, up to an effective level of Grandmaster. You must be of at least Apprentice level in a crafting skill in order to use PATIENCE to enhance that skill, and PATIENCE has no effect if you are already of Grandmaster level in the chosen skill."
Weapon Master,6,"Must be Effendal","As an Effendal, you have spent some of your long life practicing the ability to wield various weapons, with the result that your breadth of proficiency is well beyond what most humans ever achieve. This skill gives you the ability to use any weapon, although it does not grant any skill in two-weapon fighting. (That is, WEAPON MASTER is the equivalent of the following skills: SHORT WEAPONS, ONE-HANDED WEAPONS, TWO-HANDED WEAPONS, OVERSIZED WEAPON USE, THROWN WEAPONS, and BOW AND ARROW.)"

############################
# Half-Fae-specific Skills #
############################
Slippery,4,"Must be Half-Fae, Escape","As a descendant of the Fae, you have inherited a facility for being elusive, such that others find it near-impossible to capture or bind you. Whenever you use this skill, you call “escape” and may instantly pull yourself free from any kinds of bonds or snares that were trapping your character (including any Bind effects caused by, for instance, The Binding Spell). You can similarly pull yourself out of any character’s grip, even if they are using the Strength ability to hold you. You may use SLIPPERY as often as you wish."
Magic-Resistant,5*,"Must be Half-Fae","As a descendant of the Fae, you have a natural affinity for the flow of magic in the world around you; by “leaning in” to that flow, you can cause any magical effect to slip past you with no effect. When you would be affected by any magical attack, you may instead use this skill and call “resist” to avoid suffering any effects from that attack. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of MAGIC-RESISTANT you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Attractive Gesture,3*,"Must be Half-Fae","As a descendant of the Fae, you have inherited the ability to influence the minds and bodies of those around you by pulling on the strands of reality. When you use this skill, you make a “come hither” gesture at someone and call “by my gesture, attract,” which forces them to take 3 steps toward you. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of ATTRACTIVE GESTURE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Repellent Gesture,3*,"Must be Half-Fae","As a descendant of the Fae, you have inherited the ability to influence the minds and bodies of those around you by pushing on the strands of reality. When you use this skill, you make a dismissive gesture at someone and call “by my gesture, repel,” which forces them to take 3 steps directly away from you. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of REPELLENT GESTURE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Dominating Gesture,10*,"Must be Half-Fae","As a descendant of the Fae, you have inherited the ability to influence the minds and bodies of those around you by manipulating the strands of reality. When you use this skill, you point at someone and call “by my gesture, lesser dominate,” which means that the affected creature or person must do your bidding for 3 minutes. Keep in mind that, since this is a “Lesser” effect, it will not work on any Returned or other “major” characters. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always keep track of how many uses of DOMINATING GESTURE you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."

##################################
# Half-Celestial-specific Skills #
##################################
Rallying Cry,3*,"Must be Half-Celestial","As a half-celestial, you have inherited the ability to channel positive emotions through your voice, inspiring and invigorating those around you. When you use this skill, you call “by my voice, remove weakness,” thereby producing a Remove Weakness effect on everyone within earshot. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of RALLYING CRY you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Healing Touch,6*,"Must be Half-Celestial","As a half-celestial, you have inherited the ability to channel positive energy through your hands, closing even the most grievous wounds with your touch. You may touch a person or creature and call “heal 10” once. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of HEALING TOUCH you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Resurrection,10*,"Must be Half-Celestial","As a half-celestial, you have inherited the ability to reach after a person’s departing spirit and use a powerful burst of energy to pull them back into the world. To use this skill, you must touch a dead body, roleplay a moment of painful exertion, and call “life,” which returns your subject to their full Health Point total (although they must still endure a 3-minute Weakness count because of the shock of resurrection). Using this skill reduces your maximum Health Point total by 1 for the next 3 days; this reduction in maximum HP total cannot be healed through any normal means, and if you reduce your maximum HP total to 0 in this way, you immediately die. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of RESURRECTION you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."

Draining Touch,5,"Must be Half-Demon","As a half-demon, you have inherited an affinity for draining the energy of those around you in subtle but persistent ways. To use this skill, you must touch a person or creature, concentrate for 1 full second, and call “drain life 1.” Unless this effect is negated, they lose 1 Health Point (regardless of armor) and you regain 1 Health Point. You can use this skill as often as you want, and you can actually use it while you are in bleedout or suffering from a Weakness effect. This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot use any skills while in bleedout or suffering from Weakness. Note that you cannot drain any Health Points if your target is dead or in bleedout (and therefore does not currently have any HP)."
Abhorrent Sign,4*,"Must be Half-Demon","As a half-demon, you have inherited the ability to trace a hellish sigil in the air between you and an opponent, thereby rending their spirit and causing immense pain. To use this skill, you must gesture at your target and call “by my gesture, stun by pain,” causing them to be Stunned and reeling in agony for 3 seconds. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of ABHORRENT SIGN you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."
Captivating Gaze,10,"Must be Half-Demon","As a half-demon, you have inherited the ability to bend weak-minded people or creatures to your will, whether through raw domination or allure. To use this skill, you must make eye contact for 3 consecutive seconds with your target, then call “by my gaze, lesser dominate,” producing a 3- minute period during which the affected creature or person must do your bidding. Keep in mind that, since this is a “Lesser” effect, it will not work on any Returned or other “major” characters.  You may use this skill as use this skill as often as you want."

Natural Armor: (Rank 1-5),2*,"Must be Half-Dragon","As a half-dragon, you have inherited the scaled skin of your forebears, with the result that you are much more resistant to damage than people of other races. Every time you take this skill, you increase your rank by 1, up to a maximum of Rank 5; each rank provides you with 1 point of Armor Value. Unlike normal armor, though, this NATURAL ARMOR is automatically restored to its full Armor Value whenever you Rest (spend 30 minutes with no combat or strenuous activity). This Armor Value can stack with any other sources of armor, and enemies must work through your NATURAL ARMOR before they can deal damage to your other armor or Health Points."
Iron Stomach,4,"Must be Half-Dragon","As a half-dragon, you have inherited the incredibly hardy and versatile digestive system of your draconic forebears, such that you can eat foods that weaker people would be unable to stomach.  With this skill, you can eat expired food items, which are otherwise completely useless (for those without an IRON STOMACH). This skill does not enable you to eat things that are not considered “foods.”"
Thunderous Roar,4*,"Must be Half-Dragon","As a half-dragon, you have inherited the commanding presence and hardened vocal cords of your forebears; as a result, you can let out a roar that will temporarily knock everyone around you into a reeling, overwhelmed state. To use this skill, you must (loudly) call “by my voice, stun,” which will make everyone within earshot incapable of using skills, attacking, or defending themselves for 3 seconds. If you take this skill multiple times, you should always mentally keep track of how many uses of THUNDEROUS ROAR you still have available, until your character gets a chance to rest and regain their full complement of skills."

Supernatural Strength,10,"Must be Half-Celestial, Half-Demon, or Half-Dragon","As the scion of a race with the capability to manifest great physical strength, you can do things that mere humans or Effendal are absolutely incapable of. With this skill, you can produce Strength effects whenever you wish to—for instance, you can lift up and throw people with one hand, you can run while holding a person, you can attempt to bash through doors, and so on.  (Consult Chapter 13, “Effects,” for more details about Strength effects.)"
Massive Strikes,4,"Supernatural Strength","As the scion of a race with the capability to manifest great physical strength, you can swing your weapon with enough force to knock foes away from you, even if they block your attacks. With this skill, whenever you use the 3-DAMAGE STRIKE, 5-DAMAGE STRIKE, or 10-DAMAGE STRIKE skill, or are under the effect of the BATTLE RAGE or BERSERKER skill, you automatically add the Massive effect to your attacks, knocking your target back 3 steps even if they block or PARRY those attacks."
